# QuantumSniff

## Overview
QuantumSniff is a theoretical offensive Python module designed to intercept encrypted communications using side-channel attacks. Inspired by advanced espionage concepts and the real-time tracking capabilities of the "God's Eye" system from *Fast and Furious*, it explores next-generation techniques for breaching secure channels. This project is intended for educational purposes or ethical security research under controlled, authorized conditions.

**Warning**: Unauthorized use of this tool for malicious purposes is illegal under laws like the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Always obtain explicit permission before testing on any system.

## Features
- **Timing/Leakage Analysis**: Measures execution time or other side-channels to infer cryptographic secrets.  
- **Quantum-Resistant Bypass**: Targets vulnerabilities in encryption assumed to resist quantum attacks (speculative).  
- **Silent Process Injection**: Hypothetically embeds into target systems without detection (not implemented).  

## Use Cases
- **God’s Eye Context**: Real-time tracking of encrypted communications for surveillance.  
- **General Context**: Research into next-generation espionage techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Access to target system (hypothetical; not provided)  

## Dependencies
| Library         | Purpose                     | Installation              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `cryptography`  | Crypto analysis for comms   | `pip install cryptography`|  

Built-in imports used: `os`, `time`.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Code-Mornarch/Quantum-Sniff.git
   cd quantumsniff
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
QuantumSniff is a module, not a standalone script. Below is a speculative example of how it might be used (non-functional, as I can’t execute code):

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
import os
import time

def timing_attack(ciphertext):
    key = os.urandom(16)  # Random key for demonstration
    iv = os.urandom(16)
    cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CBC(iv))
    decryptor = cipher.decryptor()
    start = time.perf_counter()
    decryptor.update(ciphertext) + decryptor.finalize()
    elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start
    return elapsed  # Timing leak placeholder

def quantum_sniff(ciphertext):
    timing = timing_attack(ciphertext)
    print(f"Timing leak detected: {timing}s")
    # Silent injection/kernel hooks would go here (not implemented)
    return "Intercepted data placeholder"

# Example usage
ciphertext = b"encrypted_data_here"
quantum_sniff(ciphertext)
```

- **Steps**:  
  1. Import the module into your project.  
  2. Provide encrypted data (e.g., ciphertext) to analyze.  
  3. Run to simulate side-channel analysis.

## Technical Details
- **Crypto Analysis**: Uses `cryptography` for AES cipher operations and timing simulation.  
- **Side-Channel**: Relies on `time.perf_counter()` for high-precision timing (simplified here).  
- **Kernel Hooks**: Implied but not implemented; would require custom C-level code for real injection.

## Limitations
- Timing attack is a basic placeholder; real side-channel exploits need hardware access and precise conditions.  
- Silent injection is theoretical—requires platform-specific kernel mods not provided.  
- Effectiveness depends on target system vulnerabilities (not included).
